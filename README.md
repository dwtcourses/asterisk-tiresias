# asterisk-tiresias
Audio fingerprinting and recognition module for the Asterisk.

Audio fingerprinting and recognition algorithm implemented in c, using the libaubio's MFCCs(Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients).
[MFCCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel-frequency_cepstrum)

The asterisk-tiresias can memorize audio by listening to it once and fingerprinting it. Then by calling a dialplan application on a channel, the asterisk-triresias attempts to match the voice/audio against the fingerprints held in the database, returning the result into channel variables.
